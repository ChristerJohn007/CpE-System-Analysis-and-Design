                        <p>The objective of any cosmetic dentistry treatment is twofold.</p>
                        <p>First, the dentist and patient work together to achieve the desired physical outcome. For instance, patients with missing teeth may require dental implants to complete their smile. Alternatively, they may wish to consider dental bridges as a non-surgical option.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the patient's long-term functionality is always considered. A great smile is even better when the teeth function well, too. The doctors will ensure that every cosmetic dentistry procedure they perform maintains or improves patient function.
                            <br>
                            The end result is an incredible smile that meets the patient's aesthetic and practical dental needs.</p>
